How to use the SkipTo links
---------------------------
After loading a page, press the tab key and you will see a `Skip to...` button at the top of the page. Press enter or space to activate a menu containing all headings and sections on the current page. Press the up or down-arrow key to Select one of the items, press enter to directly jump to it. Pressing the accesskey 0 will focus the SkipTo button at any time. 

Please note that this plugin primarily is not designed to enhance accessibility for screen reader users. Modern screen readers provide their own methods to directly skip to headings and other elements. It is made to generally enhance keyboard navigation on large sites, but of course may be useful for screen reader users as well.
